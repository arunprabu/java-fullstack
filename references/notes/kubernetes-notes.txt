Kubernetes
- Introduction
- What is Kubernetes	=> container management/orchestration platform
- Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes
	- Docker Swarm
		pros
		- Ease of setup
		- Faster self healing
		- Simple to medium complex usecases
		cons
		- Lack of management console in free version
		- Complex usecase not fits well
		- Locked in to docker container
		
	- K8s
		pros
		- Open source
		- Designed to run different type of containers (docker, rkt, cri-o) => CRI (Container Runtime Interface)
		- Medium to complex usecases
		- Designed as modular and pluggable components
		- Dashboard for monitoring and management
		cons
		- complex to setup
		- required more resources to run
	
		
- Kubernetes Architecture
- Kubernetes Components
	- Master Components
		- Kube API Server	=> all external/internal communcation will be routed thru API server
		- etcd				=> key/value based datastore
		- Kube Scheduler	=> schedules the requests based on resource availability
		- Kube Controller Manager	=> collects stats from all nodes and monitor continuously to take appropriate action
		- Cloud Controller Manager	=> integration with cloud providers
			
	- Node Components
		- Kubelet			=> manages worker node
		- Container Runtime	=> can run the containers complies to CRI (Container Runtime Interface) spec
		- Kube Proxy		=> enables networking between k8s pods and nodes
		
	- Kubectl				=> k8s cli client
	
- Kubernetes Concepts (Resources / Objects)
	- Namespace
	- Manifest
		- Label
		- Annotation
		- Selector
		
	- Pod
	- Service -> ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName
	
	- Deployment
		- replication
		- rolling updates
		- rollbacks
			
	- Replication Controller	
	- ReplicaSet
	
	- StatefulSet
	- DaemonSet
	
	- Job
	- CronJob
	
	- ConfigMap
	- Secret
	
- Networking
- Volumes / Storage
	- Local FS
	- NFS
